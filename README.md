# Hi everyone :wave:

I'm a junior developer from the Brazil.
I started my journey in 2019, when i got in analysis and systems development course.
My first language was C, when i started to learn about programming logic. 
I used my years in college to study by myself web development. 
In addition to programming I also found important to learn more about good programming habits, like TDD, Agile-Methodology, Design Patterns, and still 
learning things that can help me to alwas be a better developer.
